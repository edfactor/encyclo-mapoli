# Ensure SQL files use LF line endings in the working tree and are treated as text.
# This helps avoid platform/editor differences (CRLF vs LF) and BOM-related issues
# which can cause byte-level differences and break parsers.

# Treat SQL files as text and normalize to LF
*.sql text eol=lf

# Explicitly treat common text files as text
*.md text eol=lf
*.ps1 text eol=lf
*.sh text eol=lf
*.yml text eol=lf
*.yaml text eol=lf

# Keep binary files alone
*.png binary
*.jpg binary
*.jpeg binary
*.gif binary

# Ensure repo uses consistent encoding for key source files (helpful guidance only - Git doesn't force encoding)
# Editors should save SQL as UTF-8 without BOM. If you need to remove BOMs, run the renormalize steps below.
