I would like you to come up with a plan to build a new page.

The page will be called “{PAGE NAME}” the url will be ‘{page-url}’. It will show a grid of {data type}.

The data will be supplied by a back-end service, which is a {POST|GET|PUT} operation at /api/{relative path}. The back end endpoint is at:
./src/services/src/Demoulas.ProfitSharing.Endpoints/{rest of path to file}.

I am supplying an image that shows exactly what the screen should look like. {add lots of details about features of the image, such as icon and placement choices, how to handle what buttons do, default sorting of grid columns, any special handling of columns etc} The potential back end errors are: {errors} and should be handled by {add error handling details}

As for the back end navigation, the page name will be “{PAGE NAME}”, the url will be “{page-url}” and the parent menu will be {PARENT_MENU from add-navigations-data.sql}. It should be the {order place} in order. As for roles that can access the page, it needs {list actual roles, such as SYSTEM_ADMINISTRATOR, FINANCE_MANAGER, etc}

Please follow the instruction files in ./ai-templates/front-end to understand how to build all parts of the page. Then show me your plan to build it.
