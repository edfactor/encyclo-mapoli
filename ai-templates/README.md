This directory holds instruction files for components of Profit Sharing and includes a directory called "claude-agents" that contain ready-to-use Claude Code subagent files that you can just drop into your ./claude/agents directory, and will be ready to use for task delegation.

Feel free to add, enhance, and refactor these files.
