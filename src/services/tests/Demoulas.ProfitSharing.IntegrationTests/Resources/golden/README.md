This "golden" directory consists of output from READY ran agaist the scramble data.

The scramble has been slightly altered to remove a few problematic bene members.

The reports are generated using the YE Runner's "GoldenRun" runner (which is in this repo.)

All of the files have the following convention;

RAA-RRRR

The AA is the activity which has generated the report.

The RRRR is the report name on ready minus the process id.

The outcome.json contains output from the complete run.
