This "golden" directory consists of output from READY ran agaist the scramble data.

The scramble has been slightly altered to remove a few problematic members (invalid data.)

The reports are generated using the YE Runner's "GoldenRun" runner (which is in this repo.)

All of the files have the following convention;

NN-AAA-RRRR

The NN is the order in which the report is generated during the "GoldenRun"

The AAA is the activity which has generated the report.

The RRRR is the report name on ready minus the process id.

The outcome.json contains output from the complete run.
