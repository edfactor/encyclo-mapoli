# About Profit Sharing Data Obfuscation

This project is for obfuscating the production data to protect privacy, and let application development and testing work with realistic profit sharing data.

The folder at this level contains 36 SQL and PSQL scripts that can be used to obfuscate the data in several tables that are used in Profit Sharing functions.

Exenstive documenation and a zip of the latest stable release are available in sharepoint here:
